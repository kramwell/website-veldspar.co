These patterns have an intrinsic value and give the find a calculable value, which tries to be randomised but with a realistic and real world distribution of denominations.</p>

(still in development as problems are discovered and overcome):</br></br>
There are two parallel parts to the chain;</br></br>

   1. the ORE to be mined</br></br>
   2. the traditional transactions block chain

</br></br>
To mimic real life (resource based / effort based), there is ORE to mine, but this does not go away, you can mine this forever trying to find tokens. Once found the miner can claim that token as theirs and it will be entered into the block chain as the originating owner of that token. The token value is based on a likelihood gate, and then what is essentially a pattern match against a table of magic beans.  Exponential value based on complexity resulted in too many low value tokens and the network can only ever work well with a good mix of denominations.
</br></br>
Because ORE can be mined forever, hash rate will be spread across the entire block chain not just used to crack a single block. Miners may wish to mine only a single block of ORE for many months, trying to find the highest possible value token they can, before moving onto a new one.
</br></br>
Tokens are defined as addresses describing the position within the ore they were found in, and a reproducible path to the discovery of the pattern. Once a token has been found, it is submitted to the network with the miners’ details and an agreed timestamp (by consensus). If that miner was the first to find that token then it is written into the ledger, and that token is created, and its journey starts.
</br></br>
The block chain itself is signed/sealed on a fixed time basis, so every X seconds the all of the outstanding transactions in arrears will be selected, signed and entered into the chain. Once this has been done, the hash for the block is distributed to all connected nodes, and the originating nodes will receive other nodes' hashes. Then quorum is established. If the hash you supply is outvoted by a significant proportion of the other nodes, then that block is not written to the local store, and instead a copy of the transactions is gained from several sources, compared, and the process is run again.

> No fixed reward and no fixed supply. Only a likelihood of reward/total supply, based on the amount of effort used to mine the ore. This stops early adopters from getting anything more than late adopters, because they are not rewarded for being first other than the low value easy tokens.

One of the major pain points is going to be the claiming of low value tokens, as a powerful machine may be able to find many hundreds of the smallest denominations per second, and there will be a "gold rush" as to who those tokens were allocated to, with many miners finding the same tokens. This will be helped in the main by the miners applying random mining techniques.

As it is impossible (or at least not-likely) for developers to pre-mine the token, other than "knowing" about the coin first, there is no fixed pay-out, only a reward for effort applied so this should reduce the amount of bag holding that early adopters have traditionally amassed.
</br></br>
Sequential mining is discouraged as you will be likely to find blocks which have already been claimed, therefore, randomised mining of the ore would yield the best possible return for effort.

So mining, consists of finding tokens within the ore. By default, a block of ore is 1mb of data. The miner has to try 8 x 64 byte sections of that ore, using one of 2 initial methods (prepend & append), then one of 4 hash algorithms will be used to try to find a valid token. This gives possibilities to try of approximately 1.19^58 combinations. But with there being up to 256 methods and 256 algos. Ore blocks follow a different release schedule, so may well be every 10k blocks, or 100k.

This is a tricky one for me to really wrap my head around, personally I love the idea of entirely anonymous currencies free from the outside snooping on what you have. But in a fair and balanced society, everyone should be held to account for what they hold. As only when something is free and open can trust be established. Also, if you are looking to create a crypto currency that is welcomed with open arms by payment providers and governments, a certain amount of auditing must be possible whist still allowing some anonymity.
</br></br>
This will be a tricky problem to solve as you wish to balance the two, and ensure you are protecting both sides but still allowing the network to be entirely independent and beyond the control of any single individual or agency.

There will be three data structures underlying the chain.
</br></br>
    1. The blockchain itself, containing < Blocks >, tied together with SHA512 hash of all it's transactions + previous block hash
</br>
    2. Transactions, containing the from -> to, date, ref & tokens to be reallocated
</br>
    3. Ledger, the in/out record for all tokens in the chain. Ownership can be established by looking at the last allocation of a token, and tested before spending that token. Also, registration of a token can be tested by the non-existence of an existing allocation for that token.
</br></br>
Because there will be no proof of work for the blockchain, we must secure it via consensus. With the seed nodes being authoritative whilst the network size is insufficient or quorum cannot be achieved.
</br></br>
Consensus is based (due to timing anomalies) on transactions being submitted to the network with a target block membership, which is far enough in the future to ensure it’s distribution around the network in sufficient time (say at least 1 min). Then when the next block is due to be produced the nodes will gather the outstanding transactions for the block, order the transactions by their identifier and hash them, then hash that result against the previous block.
</br></br>
The node will then send this final hash around to other nodes to gain consensus, each node will record the number of hits/misses of that hash it receives and write that into the blockchain as a record of the network quorum for that block. In the case where there is significant disagreement, then the seed nodes become authoritative, although this should never happen or be inconsequentially irregular as to not be a problem.
</br></br>
In the case where a node becomes outnumbered in it’s resolution of a block, it will not commit that block into the store, and will instead ask another node (likely a seed node) for all it’s transactions for a block, then re-process that block and check the hash now matches the consensus and if it passes then write the block into the datastore.
